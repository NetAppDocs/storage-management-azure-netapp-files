After you set up your system, you can create Azure NetApp Files accounts, capacity pools, and volumes.

== Create volumes

You can create NFS or SMB volumes in a new or existing Azure NetApp Files account.

.Before you begin

* If you want to use SMB, you must have set up DNS and Active Directory.

* When planning to create an SMB volume, you must have a Windows Active Directory server available to which you can connect. You will enter this information when creating the volume.

.Steps

. Open the Azure NetApp Files system.

. Select *Add New Volume*.

. Provide the required information on each page:

* *Azure NetApp Files Account*: Choose an existing Azure NetApp Files account or create a new account. When creating a new account, you must also select the resource group. You can use an existing resource group or create a new one.

* *Details & Tags*: Enter the volume name and size, the VNet and subnet where the volume should reside, and optionally specify tags for the volume. Choose *Standard* or *Basic* networking. *Standard* supports virtual network (VNet) features while *Basic* has reduced IP limits and no additional VNet features for the volume. For more information, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-netapp-files/configure-network-features[Configure network features^].
