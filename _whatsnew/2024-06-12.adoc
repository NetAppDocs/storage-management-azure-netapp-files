=== New permission required

The following permission is now required to manage Azure NetApp Files volumes from BlueXP:

Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read

This permission is required to read a virtual network subnet.

If you're currently managing Azure NetApp Files from BlueXP, you need to add this permission to the custom role that's associated with the Microsoft Entra application that you previously created.
